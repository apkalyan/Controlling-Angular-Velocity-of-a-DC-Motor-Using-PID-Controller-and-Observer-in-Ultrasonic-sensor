# Controlling-Angular-Velocity-of-a-DC-Motor-Using-PID-Controller-and-Observer-in-Ultrasonic-sensor
This project focuses on controlling the angular velocity of a DC motor using a PID controller and an observer, incorporating feedback from an ultrasonic sensor. A PID controller ensures accurate and stable speed control by minimizing the error between the desired and actual velocities.
